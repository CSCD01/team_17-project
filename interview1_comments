Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.

The team introduction was done satisfactorily. I suggest that you
focus more on the profesisonal aspects of the team for the second
interview.

The project was introduced satisfactorily. I suggest you practice the
demo in preparing for the second interview, to make sure it goes
smoothly and looks more professional.

As we have discussed, there are details missing in the software
process. I would be happy to replace this part of the interview grade
with what you achieve in the second interview.
