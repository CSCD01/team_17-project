# Phase 5

For the fifth phase, the team will have prepared pull requests for the respective issues, and if no previous pull request is pending for an issue, then the team will issue one.

To prepare for a pull request, all edited files in the respective branches were tested for pep8 compliance. Additionally, it was ensured that proper relevant documentation was edited. Other requirements for a pull request were already met previously, having sufficient unit tests (done in unit testing) and there being no flake8 warnings (done in system testing, the first travis build).

The only issue that didn't already have a pull request was issue 7869. A report is included containing a link to the pull request (which can also be found on the issue discussion). This report will be updated once decisions are made on the pull request. Such decisions include, the pull request being accepted, the pull request being declined, any additional commits needed to be accepted.
