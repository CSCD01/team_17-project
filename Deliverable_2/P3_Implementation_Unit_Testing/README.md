# Phase 3

For the third phase, the team will have fixed the bug in their respective branch and added unit tests. The bugs are not fixed in master, one because matplotlib asks we use a pull request directly from a branch and not master and also to demonstrate pre-bug fix behaviour. The report will specify which branch contains the fix and how to run the unit tests. It will also list the edited files and a brief technical commentary on how your changes affect the design and/or the code of the project.
